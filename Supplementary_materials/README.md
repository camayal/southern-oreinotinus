Supplementary figure 1. Multispecies coalescent tree produced in ASTRAL showing similar topology to the trees obtained using a concatenation approach. 

Supplementary figure 2. a) Multiple structure plots for different K putative genetic groups (K2 to K6) with specimens ordered by the position in the phylogeny. Each bar shows the estimated membership coefficients for a given genetic group. Iteration K=4, marked with an asterisk, is also shown in Figure 2. b) Decision plot based on two metrics from an Evanno test to select the preferred K iteration. 

Supplementary figure 3. A phylogenetic network under the coalescent model estimated with the NANUQ algorithm using 445 loci trees and their respective quartet hypothesis test. This network shows how specimens tend to be more connected with samples in the same clade, rather than connecting with other specimens geographically separated. Also, the network displays some internal connections among some clades (C6 and C7, or C1, C2, and C3).â€¯ 

Supplementary figure 4. a) Five different plots showing all components in the NMDS analysis. Convex hulls were added to C1, C5, and C7. b) Result of the iterative analysis to determine the best number of components to run in the NMDS analysis (4 components).  

Supplementary figure 5. Violin and box plots for all environmental variables (CHELSA) and elevation for all specimens (those included in the phylogeny and the occurrences downloaded from GBIF) classified into the main seven groups corresponding with each major clade in the phylogeny. See methods for details about the classification of GBIF occurrences.  

Supplementary figure 6. a) Correlogram of all environmental variables and geographic coordinates for all specimens (those included in the phylogeny and the GBIF occurrences) using a Pearson correlation. Yellow cells indicate a negative correlation, while green cells indicate a positive correlation. Brightness denotes the level of correlation,  with dark signifying a high correlation. Cells marked with an X are non-significant. b) Predicted niche for each clade using MaxEnt based on 19 CHELSA climatic variables. With the exception of C7 in the Tucumano-Boliviano forest region, the inferred climatic niches of most clades overlap significantly.  

Supplementary figure 7. Comparative matrix of Ecospat generated plots of the realized niche for each independent clade found in the phylogenetic tree against all other clades. Colored areas follow the primary legend for clades, while gray areas indicate niche overlap between the comparison. 

Supplementary table 1. Table with detailed information about the assembly and individual samples. 

Supplementary table 2. Table with detailed bioclimatic information (CHELSA) for collections included in the phylogenetic analyses, and herbarium specimens of Viburnum from the central Andean region in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. 

Supplementary table 3. Table with measurements of the specimens included in the morphological analyses.
